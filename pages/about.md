## About the Collection

Niagara is a scenic area, one of Canada's most popular tourist destinations, with its rich landscape and colourful history keeping visitors excited. In today's era, when people encounter beautiful scenery, most people will choose to take a shot and then use a mobile phone or professional camera to take it. Then these beautiful scenery photos may be sent to social platforms by people and mixed with various selfies, food, and luxury goods on the display platform of social software. People use the beauty in nature as a display of capital to satisfy their vanity. It is undeniable that this is also a recognition of the natural beauty of nature. From the barrel challenge of Niagara Falls to today's series of tourist attractions, people use this beautiful scenery to make money. The works in my exhibition run counter to the current concept. People always think they can conquer nature, tame nature to bring them more money. I chose to show more about the power of nature, including some landscapes and some human activities that people take advantage of natural landscapes. In the age of advanced electronic products, people can press the shutter of mobile phones or cameras at any time and carry these "natural forces" easily. My Exhibit will show images that highlight the forces of nature and give people a sense of how to balance the human race and mother nature  in the 19th century.
